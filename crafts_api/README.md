Hello all! Welcome to my first (but probably not my last) FastAPI project. 

In addition to making my way through the Flatiron School's Software Engineering Bootcamp, I am keeping busy with one million real-life, hands-on, creative projects. 

My goal with this FastAPI debut has been to bring some order to my to-do list. I love to learn, and I am always finding new skills to add to my belt. But while jumping between my sewing nook, planting station(s), fabric room, crafting corner, and kitchen counters, I have not yet found a way to track the progress of my various endeavors. 

Storing and organizing my project lists in one place is a step towards my goal of DIY EVERYTHING! 
I hope that this glimpse into my non-computer life inspires you to dive into a craft of your own. 

Upon launching this API, the user can see tabs for 4(four) functionalities: Get, Post, Delete, Search. 

    GET: Returns the basic code for my HTML template that presents my project data.

    POST: Allows the user to add a project to the database, data to be entered in the schema that is presented.

    DELETE: Allows the user to delete a project from the database, by the project's id. 

    SEARCH: Allows the user to search for a project by a keyword that is found either in the project name or description.

Upon launching my webpage, the user can see a minimally, cleanly styled collection of tables displaying my project data. 


More on how I developed this API using FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, and Jinja2 Templates can be found in the ABOUT.md file.
