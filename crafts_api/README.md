Hello all! Welcome to my first (but probably not my last) FastAPI project. 

In addition to making my way through the Flatiron School's Software Engineering Bootcamp, I am keeping busy with one million real-life, hands-on, creative projects. 

My goal with this FastAPI debut has been to bring some order to my to-do list. I love to learn, and I am always finding new skills to add to my belt. But between my sewing nook, planting station(s), fabric room, crafting corner, and kitchen counters, projects tend to fall between the cracks. Imagine that! 

Storing and organizing my project lists in one place is a step towards my goal of DIY EVERYTHING! 

I hope that this glimpse into my non-computer life inspires you to dive into a craft of your own.
